# arduino-uno-zumo

This repository contains the following robot programs:

## robotrotation.ino

The `robotrotation.ino` program is designed to make the robot move forward for 2 seconds, then perform a 180-degree turn and return to the starting position.

## linefollower.ino

The `linefollower.ino` program is based on the LineFollower program from the Arduino IDE. It guides the robot along a black line while playing a melody (using the ZumoBuzzerExample functionality).


## Getting Started

To get started with these programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the program file (`robotrotation.ino` or `linefollower.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the program to your robot's microcontroller.
4. Test and observe the robot's behavior.
